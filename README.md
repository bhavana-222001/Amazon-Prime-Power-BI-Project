# Amazon-Prime-Power-BI-Project

This project is a Power BI dashboard analyzing Amazon Prime Movies and TV Shows data. It visualizes key metrics using:

A filled map showing total titles by country with conditional formatting.
A donut chart comparing movies vs. TV shows.
An area chart displaying total shows by release year, segmented by type.
Two horizontal bar charts for ratings and genres by total shows.
Six cards highlighting total titles, ratings, genres, directors, earliest release year, and latest release year.
The dashboard uses a custom color scheme inspired by the Amazon Prime Video logo, with a consistent background, white borders, and rounded corners for a polished look. Data is sourced from a CSV file containing show details like type, title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, genres, and description. The project demonstrates data import, visualization design, and formatting in Power BI for effective data storytelling.
